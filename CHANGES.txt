v0.4.0 - 11/20/2020
  * Dropped support for Python 2 and 3.5.
  * To support Python 3.8, updated the function
    py_entitymatching.matcher.matcherutils.impute_table() to use current scikit-learn's
    SimpleImputer; see issue #127.

v0.3.3 - 10/19/2020
  * Started tracking release changes in CHANGES.txt.
  * Minorly updated usage of Pandas to prevent a dependency on downgraded versions.
  * Added stricter scikit-learn dependency requirements to preserve old Imputer API; will change in future release.
  * Users can now provide metadata for blackbox features (ex. left_attribute, right_attribute, etc.).
  * This is the last version of py_entitymatching that will support Python 2 and Python 3.5.
