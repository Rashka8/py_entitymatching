Overview of Command Organization
================================

The commands are organized into two parts. First, the commands that the user will typically use to
create an entity matching workflow. Second, a set of experimental commands that are expected to be
useful to create an entity matching workflow. Specifically, it includes commands  such
as  dask-based implementations for blockers and combining predictions from a set of matchers.
However, the experimental commands are not tested, so use these commands at your own risk.
